Abstract:
Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart
products. Sršen has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart
device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using
this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat
marketing strategy. The analytic techniques will provide both descriptive and predictive analysis.In addition,
data from the company’s ERP system is integrated in the analysis. The proposed techniques will help the
companies to provide smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat
smart devices and how these trends can inform to improve Bellabeat marketing strategy.
1. Introduction
This exploratory analysis case study is towards Capstone project requirement for Google Data Analytics
Professional Certificate. The case study involve to analyze a smart device data to gain insight into how
consumers are using their smart devices.The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the
company. The dataset has been made available by a Public Domain, Kaggle.
The analysis will follow the 6 phases of the Data Analysis process by the Google: Ask, Prepare, Process,
Analyze, Share, and Act.
1.1 A brief explanation of these 6 phases:
1- Ask
● Ask effective questions
● Define the scope of the analysis
● Define what success looks like
2- Prepare
● Verify data’s integrity
● Check data credibility and reliability
● Check data types
● Merge datasets
3- Process
● Clean, Remove and Transform data
● Document cleaning processes and results
4- Analyze
● Identify patterns
● Draw conclusions
● Make predictions
5- Share
● Create effective visuals
● Create a story for data
● Share insights to stakeholders
6- Act
● Give recommendations based on insights
● Solve problems
● Create something new
2. Business Understanding
The focus of this section is to understand the basic concepts of our wellness company ‘Bellabeat’. Project objectives are
derived from the Director of Marketing and later converted into data science problem definitions.
2.1. Stakeholders
● Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s co-founder and Chief Creative Officer
● Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s co-founder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
2.2. Objective
Hence, the objective for this analysis is to give a proper insight of how non-bellabeat use smart devices and
apply it to one of the bellabeat products. It would helpful for Bellabeat marketing strategy.
3. Data Understanding
This section starts with initial data collection and proceeds with activities that targets understanding the data. These
activities include first insight into the data, identifying data for analytic purposes, discovering data quality issues and/or
detecting interesting subsets to form hypothesis regarding previously undetected patterns.
3.1. Documentation, Cleaning and Preparation of data for analysis
The combined size of all the 18 datasets which is massive in size. Data cleaning in spreadsheets will be time-consuming
and slow compared to SQL or R. I am choosing R simply because I could do both data wrangling and analysis/
visualizations in the same platform. It is also an opportunity for me to learn R in a better way.
3.2 Data Credibility Check Using ROCCC Method
● Reliability: This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from 30 eligible Fitbit users, the sample size is too small,
might not reflect the overall population, therefore chances of being bias is present. However, increasing the sample size by
adding another data could help to address the limitation of small data size. Furthermore, the content section of the dataset
mentioned that ‘Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data’, further investigation and
exploration is needed to find out the criteria for being ‘eligible’ users to the submission of the personal tracker data.
● Original: The datasets are third party information from public domain by Mobius, not originally by the service provider,
Amazon Mechanical Turk. Hence, the originality of the datasets are low.
● Comprehensive: Missing information on age, gender, device type used on the tracking etc. hence, these datasets are not
comprehensive.
● Current: These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between
03.12.2016-05.12.2016.
● Cited: These datasets are considered as crowd-sourcing data generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon
Mechanical Turk, hence, the data source is considered properly cited.
A total of 18 datasets have been made available for each health-focused data collected by smart products . Each dataset captures
the details of every health-focused activity logged by the customers of bellabeat. This data that has been made publicly available
has been scrubbed to omit customer’s personal information.
4. Data Preparation
This section provides insight into the business problems before performing data modeling. The data preparation
phase include activities, such as data selection, data transformation, data cleaning and data validation. Data
preparation tasks may be performed several times and not in any given order. During this phase important
issues are addressed like selecting the relevant data, cleaning of data, discarding unacceptable data and how
the ERP system data can be integrated into the final data sets.
